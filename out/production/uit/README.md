# UIT

UIT Interpreter Techie - Simple Interpreter written in Java \
and based on several modifications of [Lox](https://github.com/munificent/craftinginterpreters) interpreter.

## ATTENTION

I'm porting to Java with different Grammar / Parser from PHP one. I think new grammar should support more since it's from Lox Lang.
